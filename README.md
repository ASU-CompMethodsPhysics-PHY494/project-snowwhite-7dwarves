# TRAPPIST-1 system (Project 2 for the 2017 class (including solution))

![Planet Hop from TRAPPIST-1e. Voted best "Hab Zone" vacation within 12 parsecs of Earth](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/system/resources/detail_files/2159_TRAPPIST-1e_1200_preview.jpg)
(From [NASA Exoplanet Exploration: Galleries: TRAPPIST-1](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/resources/2159/?linkId=34784370).)

Recently it was discovered that multiple planets orbit the ultracool dwarf star TRAPPIST-1 about 40 light years from earth. All of these planets are of a size comparable to earth and three orbit in the habitable zone of their star and are therefore possible candidates for worlds with liquid water and possibly life. Their very tight orbits bring the planets into close vicinity.  It should be possible for an observer to stand on one and to see multiple other planets in the night sky so close nearby that continents would be easily discernible with the naked eye.

Your task is to 
1. _simulate the innermost six planets of TRAPPIST-1_ and
2. _analyze the visibility of nearby planets_ and to _decide, which of these planets would be the best one to visit for planet watching._

You will write a _short report_ to communicate, discuss and summarize your reasoning and your results. The work is carried out in teams of two or three students.
